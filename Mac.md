# Introduction #

Delaboratory 0.8 for the Mac OS has been built and tested on a MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard OS 10.6.8. However, it should work on any later OS from Apple. It will not work on earlier Macs. This version is a pure 64-bit build. If you have enough memory, you should not have any trouble opening RAW images from some of the new cameras, such as the Nikon D800, which produce enormous image files (the 14-bit uncompressed lossless format NEF is 75MB).


# Details #

You will notice that Delaboratory 0.8 now offers four methods to open a RAW file - ProPhoto RGB or sRGB, each with the option to auto-brighten the image.

You can work in different color spaces, which has always been the strong point of Delaboratory. Moreover, in the expert mode, you can apply other techniques such as the local contrast, which is something similar to a pseudo-HDR tone-mapping.

Here you see LAB color corrections being applied to an image. You also see that some saturation has been applied as well.

You will notice in the drop-down menu above that you can now send to an external editor on the Mac.

If you have installed the Mac OS X native Gimp version from www.partha.com, you can now send to Gimp.

To do this, make sure that you get Gimp from the above Website and simply unzip the app into the /Application folder. Now after you have done all the color corrections in Delaboratory, you can do pixel level editing in Gimp.
