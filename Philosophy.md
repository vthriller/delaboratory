  1. ## Floating point precision ##
> > Each channel is stored as an array of floats. Float is stored on **32-bits**, so it means **96-bits per pixel** in RGB or LAB mode and 128-bits per pixel in CMYK mode. (GIMP uses 24 bits per pixel (8-bit channels), many other applications use 48-bits per pixel (16-bit channels), 96-bits per pixel can be achieved in RawTherapee and in G'MIC).
